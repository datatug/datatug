# DataTug CLI & agent for web UI

DataTug is an open-source, CLI-first data exploration platform with a Web UI, designed to help you explore, query, and connect data across multiple sources without losing context. It automatically surfaces related data — even across different systems — so you can move naturally between datasets, queries, and results.

Free for personal use, DataTug keeps your workflows transparent, versioned, and portable, whether you work locally, in GitHub, or in the cloud.

## What you can do with DataTug
- Explore data everywhere — SQL databases, cloud data sources, logs, and APIs (HTTP / REST)
- CLI-first workflows with a Web UI — dashboards, charts, and shared views
- Create parametrised queries and query sets for repeatable troubleshooting and investigation scenarios
- Automatically navigate related data across tables, views, APIs, and different data sources
- Build data pipelines to transform, combine, and enrich data
- Document schemas and metadata with a built-in wiki
- Version everything with Git — queries, dashboards, pipelines, and settings stored as readable project files
- Choose where your project lives:
  - Local directory (fully offline)
  - GitHub repository
  - DataTug Cloud

DataTug turns scattered data into a connected, navigable workspace — combining the speed of the CLI with the clarity of a Web UI for exploration, troubleshooting, and collaboration.



## What it is and why?

This is an agent service for https://datatug.app that you can run on your local machine, or some server to allow DataTug
app to scan databases & execute SQL requests.

It can be run with your user account credentials (*e.g. trusted connection*) or under some service account.

## Would you steal my data?

No, we won't.

The project is **free and open source** codes available at https://github.com/datatug/datatug. You are welcome to
check - we do not look into your data.

You can easily get executable of the agent from source codes using next command:

```
go install github.com/datatug/datatug
```

Note: _[Go language](https://golang.org/) should be [pre-installed](https://golang.org/dl/)_

## Where are metadata stored?

When DataTug agent scans or compare your database it stores meta information in a datatug project as set of simple to
understand & easy to compare JSON files.

We recommend to check-in the project to some source versioning control system like GIT.

You can run commands for different projects by passing path to DataTugProject folder. E.g.:

```
> datatug show --project ~/my-datatug-projects/DemoProject
```

Paths to the DataTug project files, and their names are stored in `~/datatug.yaml` in the root of your user's home
directory.
This allows you to address a DataTug project in a console using a short alias. Like this:

```
> datatug show -p DemoProject
```

If the current directory is a DataTug project folder you don't need to specify project name or path.

```
> datatug show
```

## How to get DataTug agent CLI?

Get from source codes by running:

```
> go install github.com/datatug/datatug
```

If it passes you are good to go:

```
> datatug --help
```

## How to run?

Check the [CLI](https://github.com/datatug/datatug) section on how to run DataTug agent.

## Supported databases

At the moment we any DB supported by [DALgo](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo). Like:

- [dalgo2firestore](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo2firestore)
- [dalgo2sql](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo2sql)

### Supported `sql` Databases:

Datatug can work with `sql` DBs if a relevant driver has been linked into `datatug`

- **SQLite** - via  [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 )
- **Microsoft SQL Server** - via [go-mssqldb](https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb)

We are open for pull requests to support other `sql` DBs.
