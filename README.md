# datatug-agent

CLI client and agent for [DataTug.app](https://datatug.app)

## What it is and why?

This is an agent service for https://datatug.app that you can run on your local machine, or some server to allow DataTug
app to scan databases & execute SQL requests.

It can be run with your user account credentials (*e.g. trusted connection*) or under some service account.

## Family of DataTug apps

The `datatug` app has a lot of modules. Some ot that modules can be run as standalone CLI apps:

- [`fsv`](../datatug-cli/apps/firestoreviewer) - A Firestore Viewer, similar to running `datatug firestore`

## Would you steal my data?

No, we won't.

The project is **free and open source** codes available at https://github.com/datatug/datatug. You are welcome to
check - we do not look into your data.

You can easily get executable of the agent from source codes using next command:

```
go install github.com/datatug/datatug
```

Note: _[Go language](https://golang.org/) should be [pre-installed](https://golang.org/dl/)_

## Where are metadata stored?

When DataTug agent scans or compare your database it stores meta information in a datatug project as set of simple to
understand & easy to compare JSON files.

We recommend to check-in the project to some source versioning control system like GIT.

You can run commands for different projects by passing path to DataTugProject folder. E.g.:

```
> datatug show --project ~/my-datatug-projects/DemoProject
```

Paths to the DataTug project files, and their names are stored in `~/datatug.yaml` in the root of your user's home
directory.
This allows you to address a DataTug project in a console using a short alias. Like this:

```
> datatug show -p DemoProject
```

If the current directory is a DataTug project folder you don't need to specify project name or path.

```
> datatug show
```

## How to get DataTug agent CLI?

Get from source codes by running:

```
> go install github.com/datatug/datatug
```

If it passes you are good to go:

```
> datatug --help
```

## How to run?

Check the [CLI](https://github.com/datatug/datatug-cli) section on how to run DataTug agent.

## Supported databases

At the moment we any DB supported by [DALgo](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo). Like:

- [dalgo2firestore](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo2firestore)
- [dalgo2sql](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo2sql)

### Supported `sql` Databases:

Datatug can work with `sql` DBs if a relevant driver has been linked into `datatug`

- **SQLite** - via  [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 )
- **Microsoft SQL Server** - via [go-mssqldb](https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb)

We are open for pull requests to support other `sql` DBs.

## Project structure

- [apps](../datatug-cli/apps) - contains mini-apps like Firestore Viewer
    - [datatug](../datatug-cli/apps/datatug) - defines `datatug` CLI commands & modules
